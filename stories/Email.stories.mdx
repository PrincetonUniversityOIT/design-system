# Email

The Communications Department at Princeton University has very specific guidance on how to represent email links:

https://communications.princeton.edu/guides-tools/princeton-editorial-style-guide

The guidance defines a very specific look for the email links, but does not represent the focus state in a way that 
is sufficiently accessible.  The Design System will supplement the recommendations from Communications to improve the
focus state while preserving the essence of the guidance that is provided.

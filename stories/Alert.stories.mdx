# Alert

An "Alert" is a section that draws attention to content that is important for the user to read.

There are different scenarios under which you might want to use an Alert:

* to draw attention to content that is intended to be very prominent on the page (such as a notice for an upcoming outage)
* to draw immediate attention to an important condition that has just arisen on the page (such as a critical error)

## Alert Section

In may be desirable to group alerts under an Alert Section to improve screen reader capabilities and provide a 
heading (visibile or invisible) for the alert section of the page.

## Implementation Notes

To accomplish this, width, height, margin, padding, borders, and word wrap are all removed to attempt to remove 
all visual impact of the component, while leaving the content in the document.

<Canvas>
    <Story name="Basic" args={{
        heading: "Alerts",
        title: "Alert Title",
        content: "This is the content of the alert.  It can be a simple paragraph or something more complex."
    }}>
      {Template.bind({})}
    </Story>
</Canvas>

/*
  Breakpoint names make an assumption that the device is being held in it's default orientation.
  For phones and tablets, this is assumed to be in portrait orientation.
  Hence, the 'apply-from-small-laptop-up' breakpoint (min-width: 900px) would also apply to tablets being held in landscape mode.
  Similarly, the 'apply-from-tablet-up' breakpoint (min-width: 600px) could also apply to some phones being held in landscape mode.

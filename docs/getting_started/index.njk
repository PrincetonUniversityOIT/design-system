<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>
    This section describes the Jazz Design System installation process for projects that use
    <a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/about-npm">NPM</a> (Node Package Manager) to manage project dependencies.
</p>
<p>
    In your javascript project, run the following command to install the Jazz Design System libraries into your project:
</p>
{% highlight "javascript" %}
npm install {{ packageData.name }}@{{ packageData.version }}
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
    The Jazz Design System project structure should accommodate most use cases.  Some options are described below:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>As part of your build process, copy the appropriate files (i.e. resources folder, jazz_serif.css,
        jazz_fonts.css, and jazz_behavior.js) from the Jazz Design System node_modules folder into the appropriate
        location in your project.  Then follow the steps in the “Basic Installation” to link the CSS and javascript
        resources into your project.
    </li>
    <li>
        If you plan to integrate the Jazz Design System with other resources in your build pipeline, you would be most
        interested in source code provided in the “src/scss” and “src/js” folders.  It is recommended that
        customizations to the Design System be made alongside Design System resources as opposed to directly
        modifying the Design System sources themselves.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Installation Without NPM</h2>

<p>
    This section describes the installation process for projects that are not using NPM to manage project dependencies.
</p>

<ol>
    <li><a href="https://???">Download</a> the desired release bundle (.zip file).</li>
    <li>Extract (unzip) the contents of the release bundle into the folder alongside the rest of the web assets that
        are to be delivered with your application or web site.</li>
    <li>Link the styles and fonts CSS files into your web page.  You may need to adjust the “href” value to suit
        your specific case:</li>
</ol>

{% highlight "html" %}
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/jazz_serif.css">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/jazz_fonts.css">
{% endhighlight %}

Link the script file in at the bottom of your web page body (<body>) and execute the logic to enable the Princeton Design System:

{% highlight "html" %}
<script src="../jazz_behavior.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript">
    PrincetonDesignSystem.enable();
</script>
{% endhighlight %}
